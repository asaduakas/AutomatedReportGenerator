Small firms constantly export messy Excel/CSV data (sales, invoices, equipment logs). They waste hours fixing formats and calculating totals.  My solution is a Streamlit app that lets users upload a raw Excel file → automatically cleans it, calculates key KPIs, and exports a formatted report (Excel + PDF).
